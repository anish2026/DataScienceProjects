### My first Data Science Project

There have been multiple prison escapes where an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter. One of the earliest instances was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.[3] Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only escaped the prison but eventually got out of Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, The 10-Second Jailbreak.[4]

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.[5] One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter. Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.

Now, let's get the data from the [List of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) Wikipedia article

At the end of this project, we can answer few questions like,

1.In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur?

2.which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

3.In which countries do helicopter prison breaks have a higher chance of success?

4.How does the number of escapees affect the success?

5.Which escapees have done it more than once?
